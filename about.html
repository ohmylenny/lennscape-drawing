    <h2>About Lennscape</h2>
    <p>
      Lennscape is a personal drawing collection created by Lenny within the Monad community. What started as a simple daily drawing practice quickly grew into a well-loved series, supported by fellow community members and now continuing as a weekly project.

Each piece in the collection is a custom illustration based on a Nads PFP, reimagined with scenic elements and signature Monad vibes. Many drawings also reflect the daily habits or personalities of the featured Nads, helping to introduce and highlight members to the broader community—especially newcomers.

New Lennscape drawings are posted weekly on the official X account [@lennscape_xyz] and archived here on this website.
